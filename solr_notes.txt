The nightly build system is set up to look in the directory
/lib_content23/record_source_for_solr_cores/apollo/data/record_dropbox
and add any records found there to the "apollo" core of both the test
and dev index.

Additionally it will submit a delete-by-id  to the "dl" core of the
associated index.

There is now a separate directory named

/lib_content23/record_source_for_solr_cores/apollo/data/record_dropbox_prod

which will be used as the source for items to be sent to the "apollo"
core of  the production index.
